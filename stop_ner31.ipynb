The number of unique stop names is reasonable (less than 500).\n","# 2. The stop names have been preprocessed to remove spaces, special characters, and converted to lowercase. This makes them more suitable for NER models, which typically require entities to be in a consistent format.\n","# 3. The unique stop names have been extracted and stored in a separate list (`unique_entities`). This list can be used to train a NER model to recognize these specific entities in text.\n","\n","# To use these stop names for NER, you can follow these steps:\n","\n","# 1. Create a training dataset consisting of sentences that contain the stop names.\n","# 2. Annotate the stop names in the training dataset with the appropriate entity type (e.g., \"STOP_NAME\").\n","# 3. Train a NER model using the training dataset.\n","# 4.
